## Week 4

In this week's class we continued our learning into processing and coding. We learnt a couple of new things we can implement in our projects.

One major thing we learnt is the inclusion of text, we learnt how to load fonts, and call text using that font, or even call for characters and such. Along with this we also learnt the “random” function so we can finally have some randomness in our code. This is great because the random function was something I’ve been waiting to learn and I think is one of the most important parts of code we can learn, since generative art has a sense of randomness to it most of the time. We also learnt how to put in images, and use our mouse cursors to grab colour form the image, allowing us to create a pretty interesting “self-drawing” program. On top of all this we also learnt how to spin things, so this class was pretty similar to past weeks, just adding more things to our coding arsenal.
