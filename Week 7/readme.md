# Week 7
So this week we further play with fonts and characters, and in this class we ended up making two different programs based around this. One was a drawing tool which drew letters where we had our mouse and another was a wiggly letter program, which was an improvement on one of the past weeks code. The old one had us placing characters wherever we clicked, and this one did the same but the letters also wiggle which is super cool. This introduces us to the constructor functions and making something like a wiggle or a jitter. Unfortunately my “randomletterserase” program just one day decided to not work so there's that, but the other one works at least!
