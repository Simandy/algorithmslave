# Week 7
So this week we load in fonts and learn how to use characters and also a little activity to make letters pop up wherever we click. This is a fun little exercise, and it is helpful knowing how to load in characters and could maybe be utilised in my project which I have basically set in stone as the jazz music maker/visualizer.
