## Week 5

This week we simply presented our pitches. I already spoke about what I am thinking to do in Week 3 but now after I have presented, talked to some people and spent more time on it I have honed in a little further to what I want to do. So I am going to create a chrome extension I think. I think it's a bit more interesting than just a website or something like that, also I want it to be a bit of fun. I am also going to stay with the invasive, virus like idea, as long as I can figure out the code for something like that, but I do want to include jazz into it. I still need to figure out exactly what it's going to do, and I think part of that is going to come from knowing what my limitations are based on chrome extensions and such. But anyways that's what I got for now and weâ€™ll see if I can come up with something interesting from it.

Here is my project pitch with my script in the comments:
