# Week 2

This week we started our coding adventure with Processing. I have only coded some HTML and lots of BASIC before so Java wasn‚Äôt insanely hard for me but I haven‚Äôt coded in years so it took awhile for me to get back into the swing of coding. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt need to use the cheat sheet or refer back to what Karen was typing since once she told me the code command I remembered it and the parameters that Java uses are pretty easy to get the hang of. Like I said this might be because I‚Äôve coded before so the language of code I already subconsciously know, but it was still a bit difficult since I haven‚Äôt coded in a while but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll change quickly. 

For our task this week we had to make a self portrait using Java. Now I wanted to try something a bit more abstract and a bit different, and I want to play with multiples. I ended up creating a sort of star pattern with my cursor, having a drawing rectangle in the middle, with another one about 200 pixels away on each corner, creating a five square drawing pattern. Now I was just going to call it a day and try to draw a face, and since the cursor was how it was it would‚Äôve ended up drawing five identical faces, but I wanted to challenge myself. So instead I decided to create five faces using rectangles, and use the cursor so that the user can draw the hair/facial hair.. I didn‚Äôt gauge how tough it would actually be, since in order to line up with the cursors I had to get the measurements exact. This took far longer than I thought so the faces only ended up consisting of three rectangles, one for the face and two for the eyes. But it‚Äôs alright I challenged myself and therefore I feel a lot better about it. I also coded it so when you pressed a button the whole thing would reset so you could redraw the hair however you want.

REMIX

Now over the week we had to remix someone else‚Äôs code to change up their portrait. I decided to remix Sam‚Äôs one since I found it very interesting. Now in one of the images it reminded me of what looked like a starry night so I wanted to try and recreate that. Firstly I cleaned up the code, there were some lines there were not needed so I got rid of those. I also changed the background to black and changed up the ellipse colours and changed the stroke of those to white to contrast with the black background. Now for the stars I tried for like an hour to create a random number generator so as you draw it would randomly draw stars everywhere but I couldn‚Äôt get it to work, nor could I get the opacity to work so I settled for drawing twelve small rectangles around the original cursor. It‚Äôs not the best but I couldn‚Äôt work out the rest for now so this is my fix. I also added a reset button on any key pressed.

For homework we were tasked to do the 12 Hour Challenge, which is essentially letting chance decide how we do something we do everyday. So I really enjoy listening to music and can‚Äôt do any work without having music playing in the background. I listen to hours of music every single day. I am also very blessed to be brought up with good friends and family with extremely different musical tastes so I am into quite a lot of different musical artists and genres, and I regularly listen to these genres. So I often only listen to a genre at a time, rarely mixing them too much. I have a ton of random playlists but I have a few playlists that just have certain genres, so using those I am going to create a new, totally random playlist taking songs out of these.

Firstly let‚Äôs grab these playlists together, most are created by me but a couple are created by other people that I listen to frequently. Here are all the playlists I‚Äôll be using along with what genre they are.

afro vibes - afrobeat 
üèÅ‚õàüñ§ - hip hop/rnb
yee to the haw - country
see you in the pit - hard rock
üß™ - psychedelic
crate diggin studio one - reggae
if i owned a diner - doo-wop
funk dance funk - dance music 
i got the bluuuuuueees they multiplying - blues
look at my lips bruv you're roowenenit - british rap
russell coight's wet dream - aussie tunes
that rare soul/funk - rare soul and funk
late night alt jazz tunes - alternative jazz
conversations in jazz - jazz
feel something - soul
vibes - old school hip hop
old school rnb - rnb

Now some playlists may have only 10 songs while others may have 50+. For this I am going to be using a 20 sided dice to pick the songs, since that's the biggest one I have, and for the shorter playlists if I reach the end I‚Äôll just go to the start and continue the count. Along with this I‚Äôll also be rolling the 20 sided dice to pick the genre, now there are only 17 playlists so if I roll anything higher I‚Äôll just simply reroll.

So that‚Äôs our playlist generator created, now how am I going to listen to it. Well firstly we can either choose to shuffle or not shuffle which will be determined by the flip of a coin. But if we don‚Äôt shuffle I‚Äôll be listening to the same order of songs everytime. To change this up I am also going to be introducing a roll to sort the playlist. Now on Spotify you can sort the playlist in a couple ways which will also be determined by a dice roll.
Title
Artist
Album
Date Added
Song Length

Head - Shuffle 
Tails - Not shuffle

Each of these can also be sorted in ascending or descending order, which will also be determined by a coin flip.

Head - Ascending
Tails - Descending

In conclusion we have two sections. The playlist generator and the listening order. The playlist generator will be two D20 rolls, one for genre and the other for song. I will not be adding duplicate songs so if I get a duplicate I‚Äôll reroll the song, but stay in the same genre. Initially I have no idea how long I want to make this playlist, but I know I want to get at least one or two songs from each genre so I‚Äôll probably use that as a way to finish the playlist generation. The second section, listening order, will change every time I start the playlist again, and will be determined by two coin flips and a D6 dice roll. The dice roll determines the playlist sort, obviously there are only five options so I‚Äôll reroll if the dice lands on six. The two coin flips will determine whether I shuffle or not and also if the sort will be ascending or descending. 

I‚Äôll post the playlist that I generated, and if I get bored then I can simply reroll and make a whole new playlist, but I think I‚Äôll stick to one for now.

So after doing my dice rolls I just decided to fill up my page and create a playlist from that. One thing I noticed is that I didn‚Äôt roll a 9, 13 or 17 for the genre so this playlist is missing Blues, Alternative Jazz and RnB, but that‚Äôs just the roll of the dice I guess, maybe next time.The playlist ended up having 33 songs with a playtime of 2 hours and 29 minutes.
